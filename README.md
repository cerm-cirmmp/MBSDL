Metal Binding Sites Deep Learning


This repo contains the code to run the physiological-adventitious MBS classifier.
The outcome of the classifier is a csv file containing the predictions for each MBS given as input.

Before running the classifier: create two empty folder 'zinc' and 'iron', then download and extract the MBS data in the respective folders.
